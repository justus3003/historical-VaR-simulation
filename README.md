# 📊 Historical Value-at-Risk (VaR) Simulation

This project implements a Historical Simulation approach to estimate Value-at-Risk (VaR) for a portfolio of stocks using Python. It includes data retrieval, portfolio construction, P&L simulation, VaR calculation, violation analysis, and interactive visualizations.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Downloads historical stock data using `yfinance`
- ✅ Computes portfolio returns from multiple assets
- ✅ Estimates 95% and 99% Historical VaR
- ✅ Detects and visualizes VaR violations
- ✅ Interactive Plotly visualizations

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Log Returns & Portfolio Aggregation  
- Historical Simulation for VaR  
- Violation detection & evaluation  
- Plotly for interactive plotting
